<h1 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h1>
<p>MAAS publishes a special view at <code>.../api/1.0/version/</code> that returns a list of the server's capabilities. It's transferred as a JSON document:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;capabilities&quot;: [&quot;name-of-capability&quot;, ...]}</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>
<p>The view is called <code>version</code> because this will, later, include version information too.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="list-of-capabilities">List of capabilities</h2>
<p>Check for the following strings in the capabilities list to see what features the MAAS server supports. Use these in preference to gating on the version when creating a client application.</p>
