<h1 id="installing-maas">Installing MAAS</h1>
<p>There are two main ways to install MAAS:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From Ubuntu's package archive on an existing Ubuntu
install. &lt;pkg-install&gt;</li>
<li>As a fresh install from Ubuntu Server install
media. &lt;disc-install&gt;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in testing the latest development version you can also check out the very latest source and build MAAS — see the hacking guide &lt;hacking&gt; — or use the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~maas-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/testing">Testing PPA</a> or the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~maas-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/dailybuilds">Daily PPA</a>. Note that these PPAs contain development versions of MAAS that are potentially unstable, so use with caution.</p>
<h2 id="installing-maas-from-the-archive">Installing MAAS from the archive</h2>
<p>Installing MAAS from packages is thankfully straightforward. There are actually several packages that go into making up a working MAAS install, but for convenience, many of these have been gathered into a virtual package called 'maas' which will install the necessary components for a 'seed cloud', that is a single server that will directly control a group of nodes. The main packages are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>maas</code> - seed cloud setup, which includes both the region controller and the cluster controller below.</li>
<li><code>maas-region-controller</code> - includes the web UI, API and database.</li>
<li><code>maas-cluster-controller</code> - controls a group (&quot;cluster&quot;) of nodes including DHCP management.</li>
<li><code>maas-dhcp</code>/<code>maas-dns</code> - required when managing dhcp/dns.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you need to separate these services or want to deploy an additional cluster controller, you should install the corresponding packages individually (see the description of a typical setup &lt;setup&gt; for more background on how a typical hardware setup might be arranged).</p>
<p>There are two suggested additional packages 'maas-dhcp' and 'maas-dns'. These set up MAAS-controlled DHCP and DNS services which greatly simplify deployment if you are running a typical setup where the MAAS controller can run the network (Note: These <strong>must</strong> be installed if you later set the options in the web interface to have MAAS manage DHCP/DNS). If you need to integrate your MAAS setup under an existing DHCP setup, see manual-dhcp</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A more up-to-date MAAS is available for the most recent Ubuntu LTS release in the Canonical cloud archive. You can activate the archive with <code>sudo add-apt-repository cloud-archive:tools</code>. Using packages from this archive is recommended as it contains important fixes and new features that are not always available in the Ubuntu archive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="install-packages">Install packages</h3>
<p>At the command line, type:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install maas maas-dhcp maas-dns</code></pre>
<p>You will see a list of packages and a confirmation message to proceed. The exact list will obviously depend on what you already have installed on your server, but expect to add about 200MB of files.</p>
<p>The configuration for the MAAS controller will automatically run and pop up this config screen:</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_cluster-config.*" /></p>
<p>Here you will need to enter the hostname for where the region controller can be contacted. In many scenarios, you may be running the region controller (i.e. the web and API interface) from a different network address, for example where a server has several network interfaces.</p>
<p>Once the configuration scripts have run you should see this message telling you that the system is ready to use:</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_controller-config.*" /></p>
<p>The web server is started last, so you have to accept this message before the service is run and you can access the Web interface. Then there are just a few more setup steps post_install</p>
<h2 id="installing-maas-from-ubuntu-server-boot-media">Installing MAAS from Ubuntu Server boot media</h2>
<p>If you are installing MAAS as part of a fresh install it is easiest to choose the &quot;Multiple Server install with MAAS&quot; option from the installer and have pretty much everything set up for you. Boot from the Ubuntu Server media and you will be greeted with the usual language selection screen:</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_01.*" /></p>
<p>On the next screen, you will see there is an entry in the menu called &quot;Multiple server install with MAAS&quot;. Use the cursor keys to select this and then press Enter.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_02.*" /></p>
<p>The installer then runs through the usual language and keyboard options. Make your selections using Tab/Cursor keys/Enter to proceed through the install. The installer will then load various drivers, which may take a moment or two.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_03.*" /></p>
<p>The next screen asks for the hostname for this server. Choose something appropriate for your network.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_04.*" /></p>
<p>Finally we get to the MAAS part! Here there are just two options. We want to &quot;Create a new MAAS on this server&quot; so go ahead and choose that one.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_05.*" /></p>
<p>The install now continues as usual. Next you will be prompted to enter a username. This will be the admin user for the actual server that MAAS will be running on (not the same as the MAAS admin user!)</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_06.*" /></p>
<p>As usual you will have the chance to encrypt your home directory. Continue to make selections based on whatever settings suit your usage.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_07.*" /></p>
<p>After making selections and partitioning storage, the system software will start to be installed. This part should only take a few minutes.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_09.*" /></p>
<p>Various packages will now be configured, including the package manager and update manager. It is important to set these up appropriately so you will receive timely updates of the MAAS server software, as well as other essential services that may run on this server.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_10.*" /></p>
<p>The configuration for MAAS will ask you to configure the host address of the server. This should be the IP address you will use to connect to the server (you may have additional interfaces e.g. to run node subnets)</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_cluster-config.*" /></p>
<p>The next screen will confirm the web address that will be used to the web interface.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_controller-config.*" /></p>
<p>After configuring any other packages the installer will finally come to and end. At this point you should eject the boot media.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_14.*" /></p>
<p>After restarting, you should be able to login to the new server with the information you supplied during the install. The MAAS software will run automatically.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_15.*" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The maas-dhcp and maas-dns packages should be installed by default, but on older releases of MAAS they won't be. If you want to have MAAS run DHCP and DNS services, you should install these packages. Check whether they are installed with:</p>
<pre><code>$ dpkg -l maas-dhcp maas-dns</code></pre>
<p>If they are missing, then:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install maas-dhcp maas-dns</code></pre>
<p>And then proceed to the post-install setup below.</p>
<h1 id="post-install-tasks">Post-Install tasks</h1>
<p>Your MAAS is now installed, but there are a few more things to be done. If you now use a web browser to connect to the region controller, you should see that MAAS is running, but there will also be some errors on the screen:</p>
<p><embed src="media/install_web-init.*" /></p>
<p>The on screen messages will tell you that there are no boot images present, and that you can't login because there is no admin user.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-superuser-account">Create a superuser account</h2>
<p>Once MAAS is installed, you'll need to create an administrator account:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo maas-region-admin createadmin --username=root --email=MYEMAIL@EXAMPLE.COM</code></pre>
<p>Substitute your own email address for <script type="text/javascript">
<!--
h='&#x45;&#88;&#x41;&#x4d;&#80;&#76;&#x45;&#46;&#x43;&#x4f;&#x4d;';a='&#64;';n='&#x4d;&#x59;&#x45;&#x4d;&#x41;&#x49;&#76;';e=n+a+h;
document.write('<a h'+'ref'+'="ma'+'ilto'+':'+e+'">'+e+'<\/'+'a'+'>');
// -->
</script><noscript>&#x4d;&#x59;&#x45;&#x4d;&#x41;&#x49;&#76;&#32;&#x61;&#116;&#32;&#x45;&#88;&#x41;&#x4d;&#80;&#76;&#x45;&#32;&#100;&#x6f;&#116;&#32;&#x43;&#x4f;&#x4d;</noscript>. You may also use a different username for your administrator account, but &quot;root&quot; is a common convention and easy to remember. The command will prompt for a password to assign to the new user.</p>
<p>You can run this command again for any further administrator accounts you may wish to create, but you need at least one.</p>
<h2 id="log-in-on-the-server">Log in on the server</h2>
<p>Looking at the region controller's main web page again, you should now see a login screen. Log in using the user name and password which you have just created.</p>
<p><embed src="media/install-login.*" /></p>
<h2 id="import-the-boot-images">Import the boot images</h2>
<p>Since version 1.7, MAAS stores the boot images in the region controller's database, from where the cluster controllers will synchronise with the region and pull images from the region to the cluster's local disk. This process is automatic and MAAS will check for and download new Ubuntu images every hour.</p>
<p>However, on a new installation you'll need to start the import process manually once you have set up your MAAS region controller. There are two ways to start the import: through the web user interface, or through the remote API.</p>
<p>To do it in the web user interface, go to the Images tab, check the boxes to say which images you want to import, and click the &quot;Import images&quot; button at the bottom of the Ubuntu section.</p>
<p><embed src="media/import-images.*" /></p>
<p>A message will appear to let you know that the import has started, and after a while, the warnings about the lack of boot images will disappear.</p>
<p>It may take a long time, depending on the speed of your Internet connection for import process to complete, as the images are several hundred megabytes. The import process will only download images that have changed since last import. You can check the progress of the import by hovering over the spinner next to each image.</p>
<p>The other way to start the import is through the region-controller API &lt;region-controller-api&gt;, which you can invoke most conveniently through the command-line interface &lt;cli&gt;.</p>
<p>To do this, connect to the MAAS API using the &quot;maas&quot; command-line client. See Logging in &lt;api-key&gt; for how to get set up with this tool. Then, run the command:</p>
<pre><code>$ maas my-maas-session boot-resources import</code></pre>
<p>(Substitute a different profile name for 'my-maas-session' if you have named yours something else.) This will initiate the download, just as if you had clicked &quot;Import images&quot; in the web user interface.</p>
<p>By default, the import is configured to download the most recent LTS release only for the amd64 architecture. Although this should suit most needs, you can change the selections on the Images tab, or over the API. Read customise boot sources &lt;/bootsources&gt; to see examples on how to do that.</p>
<h2 id="speeding-up-repeated-image-imports-by-using-a-local-mirror">Speeding up repeated image imports by using a local mirror</h2>
<p>See sstreams-mirror for information on how to set up a mirror and configure MAAS to use it.</p>
<h2 id="configure-dhcp">Configure DHCP</h2>
<p>If you want MAAS to control DHCP, you can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions at cluster-configuration to use the web UI to set up your cluster controller.</li>
<li>Use the command line interface maas by first logging in to the API &lt;api-key&gt; and then following this procedure &lt;cli-dhcp&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are manually configuring a DHCP server, you should take a look at manual-dhcp</p>
<h2 id="configure-switches-on-the-network">Configure switches on the network</h2>
<p>Some switches use Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) to negotiate a loop-free path through a root bridge. While scanning, it can make each port wait up to 50 seconds before data is allowed to be sent on the port. This delay in turn can cause problems with some applications/protocols such as PXE, DHCP and DNS, of which MAAS makes extensive use.</p>
<p>To alleviate this problem, you should enable <a href="https://www.symantec.com/business/support/index?page=content&amp;id=HOWTO6019">Portfast</a> for Cisco switches or its equivalent on other vendor equipment, which enables the ports to come up almost immediately.</p>
<p>Once everything is set up and running, you are ready to start
enlisting nodes &lt;nodes&gt;</p>
