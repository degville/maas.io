<h1 id="fixing-security-related-issues-in-maas">Fixing security-related issues in MAAS</h1>
<p>The critical thing to remember is that details of the bug <em>must not leak</em> before a package exists in the Ubuntu archive that fixes it. Only then can details be unembargoed.</p>
<p>Here's a list, in order, of things we should do.</p>
<ol>
<li>The initiator will be a security bug that is filed. Ensure that the bug is flagged as a security vulnerability, and is thusly <strong>private</strong>.</li>
<li>Notify the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security">Ubuntu Security Team</a> and subscribe them to the bug.</li>
<li>Discuss a fix for the bug in private, <strong>not</strong> public IRC channels!</li>
<li>When a fix has been decided, work out where it needs to land. It could be only trunk, or all of the released branches.</li>
<li>Make an empty branch from each release series and push up to LP. Mark the branch as <em>private security</em> <strong>before</strong> you then push up any revisions to it.</li>
<li>It's possible that the branch could be <em>public security</em> but better safe than sorry! The <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security">Ubuntu Security Team</a> may advise.</li>
<li>Do a merge proposal as normal; it should remain private due to the private branch.</li>
<li>When finished, <strong>do not</strong> land the branch. Notify the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-server">Ubuntu Server Team</a> and the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security">Ubuntu Security Team</a> that there is a patch available on the merge proposal (and subscribe the security team to it).</li>
<li>When they notify that the package(s) has/have been published to the archive, the branch(es) can now land on our upstream.</li>
</ol>
